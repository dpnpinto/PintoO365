# DockerWineOffice

The installer will install the `OfficeSetup.exe` in [docker_resources](docker_resources) folder (Microsoft Office 365 German).

You will still need a valid license to use the software longer than the trial period.

Once built, you can run the container and test it with:
```bash
wine powerpnt
```
